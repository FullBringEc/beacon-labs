## Summary

This is a playground for Beacon JavaScript API's `message-preview` method, that can be used by Beacon Builder to show a Message preview and modify its contents in real-time. You can play with it in the demo below.

## Acceptance Criteria

- While the Preview Message is visible, the Beacon enters read-only mode. This means that the FAB can't be clicked, the Message can't be closed, and the CTAs won't do anything.
- To remove the Preview Message and return the Beacon to its normal state, you can call this method with a value of `null`:

<Editor>{`Beacon('message-preview', null)`}</Editor>

- To simulate an "empty state", call this method only passing a `subtitle` with the desired text:

<Editor>
  {`Beacon('message-preview', {
  subtitle: "Customize your Message by choosing one or more options (left). A preview of your Message will be shown here...",
})`}
</Editor>

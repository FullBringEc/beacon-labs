# Inline Articles

- Branch: [`inline-articles`](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon2/tree/inline-articles)
- **Stage 1**

## What's this?

Initial discovery of the Inline Articles feature. This is based on [a spec](https://trello.com/c/v6tP7T3X/19-5-in-page-article-links) that Buzz created over a year ago, so it probably needs review. This page serves as a playground for testing and experimentation.

## Demo

<div>
  <h3>Take this for a spin: <a href="#" data-beacon-article-inline="5cac9a5d2c7d3a154461f02c">click here ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h3>
  <h3 style={{textAlign: 'right'}}><a href="#" data-beacon-article-inline="5cac9a5d2c7d3a154461f02c">ðŸ‘‰ Or click here</a></h3>
  <p style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>If there's not enough space to the right of the link, it should show up on the left.</p>
</div>

## How it works

The usage is really similar to the feature that opens an article in Beacon by adding the `data-beacon-article` attribute to a link, except that for it to open "inline", you'll use the `data-beacon-article-inline` attribute:

```
<a href="#" data-beacon-article-inline="5cac9a5d2c7d3a154461f02c">Click here</a>
```

## Additional Exploration

The groundwork for this feature involves setting up a new `iframe` to hold the Article and display _outside_ of the Beacon.
Once we have this in place, we can play with formats to open an article with relatively little effort. Here are a couple of examples:

### `data-beacon-article-modal`

<ul>
  <li>Open Article in a modal: <a href="#" data-beacon-article-modal="5cac9a5d2c7d3a154461f02c">click here ðŸ‘ˆ</a></li>
</ul>

### `data-beacon-article-sidebar`

<ul>
  <li>Open Article in a sidebar: <a href="#" data-beacon-article-sidebar="5cac9a5d2c7d3a154461f02c">click here ðŸ‘ˆ</a></li>
</ul>

## Known Issues

- <s>There are a couple of styling issues with the article's contents.</s>
- <s>The scalation modal doesn't work. If you leave bad feedback for an article nothing will happen and you'll probably need to refresh the page to continue testing.</s>
- <s>Scrolling messes up with the positioning. If you scroll before clicking the link, it will be off by the amount of pixels you scrolled.</s>
- We probably need vertical position awareness.
- It should work correctly when resizing the window.

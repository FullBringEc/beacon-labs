# Greeter Preview

- Branch: [`greeter-preview`](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon2/tree/greeter-preview)
- **Stage 0**

## Summary

This feature branch adds a new `greeter-preview` method to the Beacon JavaScript API that can be used by Beacon Builder to show a Greeter preview and modify its contents in real-time. You can play with it in the demo below.

## Demo

<Editor>
  {
`Beacon('greeter-preview', {
  title: "Need help?",
  subtitle: "The J&G Team is here",
  message: "The J&G Support Team are always happy to answer your questions and lend a hand with the app. Let's talk...",
  action: {
    type: "open-beacon",
    text: "Contact Us"
  }
})`
  }
</Editor>

## Acceptance Criteria

- While the preview Greeter is visible, the Beacon enters read-only mode. This means that the FAB can't be clicked, the Greeter can't be closed, and the CTAs won't do anything.
- You can call the `greeter-preview` method with a value of `null` to return the Beacon to its normal state.

<Editor>
  {
`Beacon('greeter-preview', null)`
  }
</Editor>

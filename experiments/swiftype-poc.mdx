# Swiftype Integration POC

- Branch: [`swiftype-poc`](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon2/tree/swiftype-poc)
- **Stage 0**

## What's this?

Proof of Concept that explores an integration between Beacon and [Swiftype Site Search](https://swiftype.com/site-search) service.

This particular example uses a mix of Help Scout Docs and a Swiftype Engine to power search results, so every time you search for something,
two requests are made: one request uses Beacon API to search on the Docs Site linked to the Beacon (like a regular Beacon), and the other one uses Swiftype's API with an "Engine ID" (a public key) to
search in a specific Engine that has been seeded with the contents of our [developer's site](https://developer.helpscout.com).

## Try it out

Open the Beacon and search for something like `mailbox api`, `css`, or `beacon`. Results should show in two sections.

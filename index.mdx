# Overview

**Welcome to the Lab!** Here are some of the things you can expect to find here:

- Interactive demos of Beacon JS API methods.
- Examples of how to use Beacon to perform advanced tasks.
- Interactive [Experiments](#Experiments) with features currently in discovery or in progress.
- Proofs of Concepts.

## Experiments

**Experiments** are built using experimental feature branches of Beacon. They're a simple way to test, share, and document ideas; and they're a great resource for the discovery of a new feature.
Experiments can (and often will) include new screens, components, or Beacon JS API methods that are not available to use in production,
**so please don't share them with customers or use them as production-ready documentation**.

There are five **stages** in which an Experiment can be in. This serves as an indicator of its level of maturity, but there aren't any hard guidelines about moving an experiment from one stage to the next.
The stages are:

- **Stage 0:** the feature is part of an early-stage discovery, the code is messy and it has no tests.
- **Stage 1:** the feature was developed following a spec, has minimum code coverage, and it's still in progress.
- **Stage 2:** the feature is complete and it's undergoing the final rounds of testing.
- **Stage 3:** the feature is production-ready and it will soon be included in a production release of Beacon.
- **Stage 4:** the feature has been released to production.
